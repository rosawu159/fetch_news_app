# ðŸ“° Fetch News Summarizer

### Generate summaries of news articles or blog posts using Google's language model Pegasus via ðŸ¤— HuggingFace's API. 

Pegasus is an encoder-decoder style transformer, specifically trained for abstractive summarization tasks. For this app I used the checkpoint: [google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail](https://huggingface.co/google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail), trained on the CNN-Dailymail corpus.

## About this app

- Create a [free account](https://huggingface.co/join) or [login](https://huggingface.co/login)
- Go to **Settings** and then **Access Tokens**
- Create a new Token (select 'read' role)
- Paste your API key in the app's text box

**Considerations:**
- The model works best with articles in English
- Articles behind paywall restrictions can't be accessed
- Longer articles require more processing time and resources
- It may not be possible to scrape some websites
